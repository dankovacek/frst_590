    abstract = {Changes in the river flood regime may be due to atmospheric processes (e.g., increasing precipitation),
                catchment processes (e.g., soil compaction associated with land use change), and river system processes (
                e.g., loss of retention volume in the floodplains). This paper proposes a new framework for attributing
                flood changes to these drivers based on a regional analysis. We exploit the scaling characteristics (i.e.
                , fingerprints) with catchment area of the effects of the drivers on flood changes. The estimation of
                their relative contributions is framed in Bayesian terms. Analysis of a synthetic, controlled case
                suggests that the accuracy of the regional attribution increases with increasing number of sites and
                record lengths, decreases with increasing regional heterogeneity, increases with increasing difference of
                the scaling fingerprints, and decreases with an increase of their prior uncertainty. The applicability of
                the framework is illustrated for a case study set in Austria, where positive flood trends have been
                observed at many sites in the past decades. The individual scaling fingerprints related to the
                atmospheric, catchment, and river system processes are estimated from rainfall data and simple
                hydrological modeling. Although the distributions of the contributions are rather wide, the attribution
                identifies precipitation change as the main driver of flood change in the study region. Overall, it is
                suggested that the extension from local attribution to a regional framework, including multiple drivers
                and explicit estimation of uncertainty, could constitute a similar shift in flood change attribution as

    abstract = {Much sampling to detect and quantify human environmental disturbances is flawed by a lack of appropriate
                replication. BACI (Before—After—Control—Impact) designs have only a single control location, and any
                conclusions from them are illogical. Asymmetrical designs using one putatively impacted and several
                control locations can reliably detect a variety of environmental impacts, including those that do not
                affect long—run mean abundances, but do alter temporal variance. When abundances of populations in
                different locations show temporal interaction, the asymmetrical designs allow tests for impact that are
                not possible in BACI designs. Asymmetrical designs are also extendable to sample at hierarchical spatial
                and temporal scales. The power of tests using asymmetrical designs is great for non—interactive sets of
                abundances, but greatest for pulse (short—term) responses to disturbances, large alterations of temporal
                variance, or combinations of temporal variance, or combinations of sustained, press responses in mean
                abundance coupled with altered temporal heterogeneity. Power in temporally interactive sets of data is
                generally poor. Alternatives to pre—disturbance sampling, including generalized assessment of spatial and
                temporal variances and experimental impacts, may provide better guidance for detection of human

    pages = {280-292},
    abstract = {The paired watershed experiments of Likens and coworkers in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest are
                examples of a classical design in ecology, in which a response in a manipulated unit is compared both to
                the response in the same unit before manipulation and to the response in an adjacent reference unit that
                remains undisturbed. Early proponents of this design did not attempt statistical analysis of their
                results but, more recently, before-after-control-impact analysis and randomized intervention analysis
                have been used by ecologists to draw statistical inferences from such data. These methods are simply
                two-sample comparisons (before vs. after) of between-unit differences, with significant results often
                interpreted as evidence for an effect of the intervention. This approach ignores variation caused by
                differences between units in the trajectories of the response through time, and it does not take into
                account possible serial correlation of errors. Consequently, the null hypothesis may be rejected much too
                often. I develop a new, two-stage analysis method that addresses these shortcomings by correcting for
                serial correlation and using half-series means to assess temporal variation. Unlike paired intervention
                analysis, the resulting test has close to the nominal level when the time course of the response is
                allowed to vary between units, but its power is extremely limited due to the lack of true replication in
                the design.},

    abstract = {Historical trends in annual discharge characteristics were evaluated for 11 gauging stations located
                throughout Iowa. Discharge records from nine eight‐digit hydrologic unit code (HUC‐8) watersheds were
                examined for the period 1940 to 2000, whereas data for two larger river systems (Cedar and Des Moines
                Rivers) were examined for a longer period of record (1903 to 2000). In nearly all watersheds evaluated,
                annual base flow, annual minimum flow, and the annual base flow percentage significantly increased over
                time. Some rivers also exhibited increasing trends in total annual discharge, whereas only the Maquoketa
                River had significantly decreased annual maximum flows. Regression of stream discharge versus
                precipitation indicated that more precipitation is being routed into streams as base flow than as storm
                flow in the second half of the 20th Century. Reasons for the observed stream flow trends are hypothesized
                to include improved conservation practices, greater artificial drainage, increasing row crop production,
                and channel incision. Each of these reasons is consistent with the observed trends, and all are likely
                responsible to some degree in most watersheds.},

             the contiguous United States},
    journal = {Water Resources Research},
    volume = {47},
    abstract = { Both climate change and human activities are known to have induced changes to hydrology. Consequently,
                quantifying the net impact of human contribution to the streamflow change is a challenge. In this paper,
                a decomposition method based on the Budyko hypothesis is used to quantify the climate (i.e.,
                precipitation and potential evaporation change) and direct human impact on mean annual streamflow (MAS)
                for 413 watersheds in the contiguous United States. The data for annual precipitation, runoff, and
                potential evaporation are obtained from the international Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX),
                which is often assumed to only include gauges unaffected by human interferences. The data are split into
                two periods (19481970 and 19712003) to quantify the change over time. Although climate is found to affect
                MAS more than direct human impact, the results show that assuming the MOPEX data set to be unaffected by
                human activities is far from realistic. Climate change causes increasing MAS in most watersheds, while
                the direct human-induced change is spatially heterogeneous in the contiguous United States, with strong
                regional patterns, e.g., human activities causing increased MAS in the Midwest and significantly
                decreased MAS in the High Plains. The climate- and human-induced changes are found to be more severe in
                arid regions, where water is limited. Comparing the results to a collection of independent data sets
                indicates that the estimated direct human impacts on MAS in this largely nonurban set of watersheds might
                be attributed to several human activities, such as cropland expansion, irrigation, and the construction
                of reservoirs.},

    abstract = {The question whether the magnitude and frequency of floods have changed due to climate change or other
                drivers of change is of high interest. The number of flood trend studies is rapidly rising. When changes
                are detected, many studies link the identified change to the underlying causes, i.e. they attribute the
                changes in flood behaviour to certain drivers of change. We propose a hypothesis testing framework for
                trend attribution which consists of essential ingredients for a sound attribution: evidence of
                consistency, evidence of inconsistency, and provision of confidence statement. Further, we evaluate the
                current state-of-the-art of flood trend attribution. We assess how selected recent studies approach the
                attribution problem, and to which extent their attribution statements seem defendable. In our opinion,
                the current state of flood trend attribution is poor. Attribution statements are mostly based on
                qualitative reasoning or even speculation. Typically, the focus of flood trend studies is the detection
                of change, i.e. the statistical analysis of time series, and attribution is regarded as an appendix: (1)
                flood time series are analysed by means of trend tests, (2) if a significant change is detected, a
                hypothesis on the cause of change is given, and (3) explanations or published studies are sought which
                support the hypothesis. We believe that we need a change in perspective and more scientific rigour:
                detection should be seen as an integral part of the more challenging attribution problem, and detection
                and attribution should be placed in a sound hypothesis testing framework.},

                of harm is context‐dependent. Climate scientists sometimes analyze “extreme events,” like storms, floods,
                or droughts, and try to determine whether such extreme events were partially caused by climate change or
                not. The standard method for doing this analysis is called the “risk‐based” method. It carries the risk
                of underestimating the role of global climate change in extreme events and missing connections that are
                really there. A new, “storyline,” method has recently been proposed, meant to be applied when the
                conditions needed for the risk‐based method are lacking. The storyline method is like an autopsy: it
                gives an account of the causes of the extreme event—the flood or storm—and can indicate whether climate
                change was one of these causes. It carries the risk of false alarms, or of overstating the role of
                climate change. Proponents of each account are concerned about different risks. On our analysis, the two
                approaches are complementary, and the resistance to the storyline approach has arisen from undue
                conservatism and an under‐appreciation of how much scientific methods can and do change over time. We
                advocate more discussion of the societal risks of extreme events; the choice of method should depend on
                which risk is more worrisome in the case at hand. A new, storyline, approach to analysis of extreme
                weather events has been offered, but encountered great resistance, which we explore Storyline methods may
                overstate anthropogenic contributions to extreme events, while risk‐based methods may understate them We

                Part I of this paper, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) was modified to simulate the
                effects of irrigation at subgrid scales. Simulations of nine April–October periods (three drought, three
                normal, and three pluvial) over the Great Plains were completed to assess the full impact of irrigation
                on the water budget. Averaged over all simulated years, irrigation over the Great Plains contributes to
                May–September evapotranspiration increases of approximately 4% and precipitation increases of 1%, with
                localized increases of up to 20%. Results from these WRF simulations are used along with a backward
                trajectory analysis to identify where evapotranspiration from irrigated fields falls as precipitation (
                i.e., irrigation-induced precipitation) and how irrigation impacts precipitation recycling. On average,
                only 15.8% of evapotranspiration from irrigated fields falls as precipitation over the Great Plains,
                resulting in 5.11 mm of May–September irrigation-induced precipitation and contributing to 6.71 mm of
                recycled precipitation. Reductions in nonrecycled precipitation suggest that irrigation reduces
                precipitation of moisture advected into the region. The heaviest irrigation-induced precipitation is
                coincident with simulated and observed precipitation increases, suggesting that observed precipitation
                increases in north-central Nebraska are strongly related to evapotranspiration of irrigated water. Water
                losses due to evapotranspiration are much larger than irrigation-induced precipitation and recycled
                precipitation increases, confirming that irrigation results in net water loss over the Great Plains.},

                \mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{\lambda }}_{\mathrm{i}}^{2}$. The dof statistics are applied to monthly anomalies of
                ten-year datasets using daily 1000-mb heights of the T-21 representation of observations (ECMWF analyses
                1980–89) and model simulations (ECHAM2) for the Northern Hemisphere mid- and higher latitudes (NH) and
                the eastern North Atlantic/European sector. Scales are distinguished by using unfiltered, low-, and
                bandpass filtered datasets. The following results are of interest: (i) The dofs of the observations are
                in qualitative agreement with the number of distinct weather types defined by phenomenological studies of
                the synoptic climatology on the hemispheric and regional scale. (ii) The larger number of dofs in summer
                (than in winter) can be associated with the reduced forecast performance of NWP models in the anomaly
                correlation sense. (iii) The larger number of ECHAM2 dofs for bandpass filtered anomalies (compared with
                observations) reveals the model's inability to activate as few modes as the atmosphere. (iv) Interannual
                variability is characterized by dof differences between daily anomalies taken from individual monthly
                averages and from the climate mean.},

    abstract = {Interpreting statistical data as evidence, Statistical Evidence: A Likelihood Paradigm focuses on the
                law of likelihood, fundamental to solving many of the problems associated with interpreting data in this
                way. Statistics has long neglected this principle, resulting in a seriously defective methodology. This
                book redresses the balance, explaining why science has clung to a defective methodology despite its
                well-known defects. After examining the strengths and weaknesses of the work of Neyman and Pearson and
                the Fisher paradigm, the author proposes an alternative paradigm which provides, in the law of likelihood
                , the explicit concept of evidence missing from the other paradigms. At the same time, this new paradigm
                retains the elements of objective measurement and control of the frequency of misleading results,
                features which made the old paradigms so important to science. The likelihood paradigm leads to
                statistical methods that have a compelling rationale and an elegant simplicity, no longer forcing the

    abstract = {This paper puts forward an overall view of statistics. It is argued that statistics is the study of
                uncertainty. The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the
                probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on
                probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods
                for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood
                and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to
                decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and
                law. The paper has been written in the hope that it will be intelligible to all who are interested in
